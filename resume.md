## Experience

### Software Engineer – Asurion, LLC – Jun 2018 → Current

### Software Test Engineer – The General® – Jul 2015 → Jun 2018

node.js, javascript, jest, node-fetch, selenium-webdriver, webautomator, kotlin, protractor, typescript, jsonschema, react-json-
schema-form

- Significantly reduce time to production by transforming actual production data into hundreds of test scenarios for a complex system; identified issues early and often throughout the development process.
- Design and develop context-aware web UI automation tool making test scripts no longer rely on complicated and fragile locators used in traditional Selenium tests.
- Engineer production software on an application development team focusing more on quality than quantity but helping accomplish both through implementing stories, mentoring team members (software engineers and quality analysts), and catching issues earlier through high-expectation code reviews.
- Research, prototype, and provide replacement stack & strategy for mission critical, schema-driven system built in-house over a 2+ year period which was impeding development both in quantity and quality due to design decisions. Replacement implementation only took a few months and greatly improved developers' morale and ability to produce quality code quickly.
- Create and maintain CI/CD automated service API and end-to-end UI regression tests for existing and new systems.
